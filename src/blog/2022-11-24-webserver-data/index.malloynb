## [Try it First.](https://lloydtabb.github.io/babynames/#/default)

Believe it or not, the page [below runs](https://lloydtabb.github.io/babynames/#/default?page=about) entirely in your web browser. The SQL database engine (DuckDB) is running in your browser. The Malloy compiler is running in your browser too. The [whole](https://github.com/lloydtabb/babynames) application is built with [200 lines of Malloy code](https://github.com/lloydtabb/babynames/blob/main/names.malloy), a [config file](https://github.com/lloydtabb/babynames/blob/main/composer.json), a [markdown document](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lloydtabb/babynames/main/names.md) and a [single html file](https://github.com/lloydtabb/babynames/blob/main/index.html). Just look at the [repository on Github](https://github.com/lloydtabb/babynames).

# Want to do this with your own data set?

It’s easy, just follow the three steps below.

## Step 1: Build a Malloy Data Model

Install VSCode and add the [Malloy Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=malloydata.malloy-vscode). Build and test your data model.

## Step 2: Add the index.html, composer.json and names.md

The file <code>index.html</code> shouldn’t need any modification. Edit the <code>composer.json</code> to point at your malloy file and the tables that it uses. Rename and edit the names file to have queries that are interesting to you.

## Step 3: Serve from any webserver

We use [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to serve the above example. Check in all your source code, turn on Github Pages and your whole repository is available from the web. Point a browser at the root and composer should be running.
