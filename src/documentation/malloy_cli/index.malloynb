# About the Malloy CLI

The [Malloy CLI](https://github.com/malloydata/malloy-cli) is a command-line interface for running `.malloysql` and `.malloy` files. It can be used to automate transformations, build simple pipelines, or even integrate compiled Malloy SQL into other applications.

## Installation

You can download the latest release of the Malloy-CLI from [here](https://github.com/malloydata/malloy-cli/releases).

If you have npm/npx installed, you can also run the CLI by either installing it (`npm install -g malloy-cli`) or using npx to run it `npx malloy-cli {your command here}`

### Mac users

Please note that the CLI is currently not notarized (this is a work in progress). Running the CLI binary downloaded from our download link requires opening Privacy and Security MacOS settings and explicitly allowing it.

## Setup

The CLI stores connection configuration in `~/.config/malloy/malloy-config.json`. This file uses the shared `malloy-config.json` format described in the [Configuration](../setup/config.malloynb) documentation.

For detailed setup instructions including environment variables, connection commands, and database-specific configuration, see **[CLI Setup](../setup/cli.malloynb)**.

### Default Connections

Two connections are created automatically if you don't already have a name that overrides them — `bigquery` and `duckdb`. If `.malloy` or `.malloysql` files reference these connection names, they work without explicit setup. DuckDB uses a built-in instance, and BigQuery attempts to connect using any existing gcloud authentication on your computer.

## Usage

The main commands of the CLI are `run` and `compile` — `run` executes queries and returns results, whereas `compile` returns SQL for a query or many queries.

The CLI has detailed usage information for each command. You can get general help with `malloy-cli --help`, and command-specific help and options with `malloy-cli {command} --help`
