# Transposed Tables
For comparison, it is often interesting to turn a table on it's side.  The `# transpose` tag on a query does just that.

>>>malloy
source: airports is duckdb.table('../data/airports.parquet') extend {
  measure: airport_count is count()
}

## Normal Table

>>>malloy
#(docs) size=large
run: airports -> {
  group_by: fac_type
  aggregate: 
    airport_count
    californa_count is airport_count { where: state = 'CA' }
    ny_count is airport_count { where: state = 'CA' }
    major_count is airport_count { where: major = 'Y' }
    average_elevation is elevation.avg()
}
