## Pick values must match
The types of each `pick` (and the `else` if it is present), in a pick statement must match.
A message `type 'TYPENAME', expected 'TYPENAME'` indicates that the referenced source line
contains an expression whose type does not match the first `pick` in the pick statement. For example,
the following code would generate this error

    select: bad_pick is pick 1 when true else 'one'
